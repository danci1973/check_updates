=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Some versions of yum deliver a wrong number of security updates. For example

        $ yum --security  check-update
        Loaded plugins: downloadonly, product-id, rhnplugin, security
        This system is receiving updates from RHN Classic or RHN Satellite.
        Limiting package lists to security relevant ones
        No packages needed for security; 7 packages available

        mysql-libs.i686                                  5.1.73-5.el6_6                                   rhel-x86_64-server-6

Either is mysql-libs a security update (and the text should report it) or the package is wrongly listed. If yum delivers a wrong count, the plugin will do the same.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to matteo@corti.li,
or through the web interface at https://github.com/matteocorti/check_updates/issues

Be sure to include the output produced by the plugin with the --verbose option:

  check_updates -v -v -v
