# check\_updates

check\_updates is a Nagios plugin to check if RedHat or Fedora system
is up-to-date

The plugin uses either YUM, DNF or up2date depending on the operating
system.

## Security

If at least a security update is available the plugin will return a critical status.
This can be overridden with the `--number-only` command line option

## up2date

Since `up2date -l` to list the outdated packages can only be run be run
by root the plugin must be executed as root. Please configure sudo as
follows:

```
nagios ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/up2date -l
```

and execute the plugin with sudo

```
sudo $INSTALLATION_PATH/check_updates
```

## DNF

DNF uses different caches per user. This has the consequence that DNF
and the plugin will potentially deliver different results for
different users.

 - Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x, CentOS 6.x, Scientific Linux 6.x systems:

```
